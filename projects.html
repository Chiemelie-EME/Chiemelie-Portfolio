      <h2>1. Semester Group Website Project</h2>
      <p><strong>Course:</strong> PROG1915 – Project Planning<br>
         <strong>Instructor:</strong> Shriya Bhat<br>
         <strong>Team:</strong> Group 5 – Kang Hong, Edokwe Chiemelie, Rupinderjit Kaur</p>
      <p>For this group project, we planned, designed, and developed a fully responsive website as part of our semester coursework. The assignment involved detailed planning using MS Project and JIRA, wireframing, high-fidelity visual design, and final deployment of the website.</p>
      <p>I was responsible for <strong>content research, image collection, and UI design</strong>. This included selecting layout components, color schemes, and ensuring consistency in user experience.</p>
      <p>The final deliverable included a working website, project documentation, and a team presentation.</p>

      <h2>2. Full Semester Planning Using MS Project & JIRA</h2>
      <p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Program Course Planner<br>
         <strong>Tools:</strong> Microsoft Project, JIRA<br>
         <strong>Scope:</strong> All courses, quizzes, deliverables, and final exams (Semester 1)</p>
      <p>This individual assignment required building a full semester course schedule using Microsoft Project and JIRA. It included all group and individual assignments, quizzes, and exams across all enrolled courses.</p>
      <p>The MS Project file was structured with task dependencies, milestones, and weekly schedules. In JIRA, I broke down each deliverable into sprints, created user stories, and linked tasks with due dates and statuses. This helped develop real-world Agile planning and workload management skills.</p>

      <h2>3. Personal Portfolio Website Project</h2>
      <p><strong>Course:</strong> PROG1836 – Web Design<br>
         <strong>Instructor:</strong> Mohammad Farooqi</p>
      <p>This portfolio website was built to showcase my work, skills, and creativity throughout the Web Design course. It includes eight pages: Home, About Me, Skills, Resume, Projects, Contact, Favorite Links, and a Bonus Feature.</p>
      <p>The website is fully responsive and styled using external CSS. A contact form, a resume section, and a YouTube-embedded bonus page were also implemented. This project served as a demonstration of everything I learned in HTML, CSS, and frontend best practices.</p>
